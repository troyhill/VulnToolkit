\title{Calculates the duration of the median (or other percentile) flooding event}
\usage{
dur.events(level, elevation, percentile = 0.5, units = "1 observation")
}
\arguments{
\item{level}{a numeric vector of water levels or tide data}

\item{elevation}{elevation(s) of interest (e.g., marsh platform, MHW). A vector 
of elevations is accepted. Elevation should be in the same vertical datum as \code{level}}

\item{percentile}{the percentile(s) to find (median flooding event is used by default)}

\item{units}{the time interval between measurements. This argument enables conversion of 
flooding durations to hours. \code{units} must be a string of the form \code{XX units}, 
where \code{XX} is an integer and \code{units} can be \code{second}, \code{minute}, 
\code{hour}, or their plurals. When time units are specified, all time units are 
converted to hours in output. When units are not specified, the output reports the 
number of sequential observations}
}
\value{
the duration of the median (or other percentile) flooding event occurring at a given 
elevation. If \code{percentile} is of length one, the value(s) returned are the 
corresponding flooding duration percentiles for the elevation(s) of interest. To ensure 
clarity when more than one \code{percentile} is sought, in those cases a dataframe is 
output to report elevations and flooding durations
}
\description{
Calculates the duration of the median (or other percentile) flooding event
}
\details{
The duration of individual flooding events is calculated from water level data.
 \code{dur.events()} differs from \code{fld.dur()} in that the former examines 
 individual flooding events, rather than cumulative inundation times.
}
\examples{
data(NL_6min_2013)
MHW <- 0.9117  # New London MHW in 2013: 0.9117 m relative to MLLW

# median flooding duration at three elevations
dur.events(NL_6min_2013[, 2], elevation = c(0.5, MHW, 1.5), units = "6 minutes")

# a dataframe is output when results are more complex
dur.events(NL_6min_2013[, 2], elevation = MHW, 
           percentile = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9), units = "6 minutes")
dur.events(NL_6min_2013[, 2], elevation = c(0.5, MHW, 1.5), 
  percentile = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9), units = "6 minutes")

# dur.events() differs from fld.dur() in that it examines individual
# flooding events, rather than cumulative inundation

# The median flooding event at MHW lasts 2.9 hrs
dur.events(NL_6min_2013[, 2], elevation = MHW, units = "6 minutes")

# And over an entire year, MHW was flooded 13\% of the time
fld.dur(z = MHW, NL_6min_2013[, 2])
