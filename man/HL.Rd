\title{Extracts high and low tides from a record of water levels}
\usage{
HL(
  level,
  time,
  period = 13,
  phantom = TRUE,
  tides = "all",
  semidiurnal = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{level}{a numeric vector of water levels}

\item{time}{a vector (numeric or POSIX*) indicating the time of water 
level measurements. Units must be minutes.}

\item{period}{a single numeric or integer estimate of tidal period 
(full tidal cycle). Units must be hours.}

\item{phantom}{a protective measure taken to prevent the inclusion of an 
artificial ('phantom') high or low tide at the end of the dataset, which occurs because the final observation is always a local maxima/minima for the period following the previous low/high tide. If the water level 
measurements end precisely at a low or high tide, this can be changed to FALSE.}

\item{tides}{is used to optionally subset the output to include 
only high or low tides. This argument can be 'all' (default), 'H', or 'L'}

\item{semidiurnal}{logical. If TRUE, higher- and lower- high/low tides are reported in a separate column called 'tide2'. Tides are grouped by day and assigned higher- or lower- status. When a single high or low tide exists in a day, tides on adjacent days are used to make an assignment.}

\item{verbose}{logical. If TRUE, messages are returned to console identifying the presence of NAs in the input data}
}
\value{
a dataframe of tide levels, associated time stamps, and tide 
type ('H' or 'L'). If there are NAs present in the water level or time datasets, a message reports this information in the console but the NAs are not removed or otherwise acted upon. The column indicating semidiurnal tides (`tide2`) may be NA if tides are identical or in cases where there is a single tide in the first day of the dataset.
}
\description{
Extracts high and low tides from a record of water levels. For reliable results, the time interval between samples must be constant throughout the dataset (e.g., 1 sample per hour, 1 sample per 6 minutes). Datasets with irregularly-spaced observations should be expanded to the smallest time interval to avoid issues.

HL.NL <- VulnToolkit::HL(level = NL_6min_2013[,2], time = NL_6min_2013[,1])

### Important note: Problems arise when using irregularly-spaced data.
### The best solution is for the user to ensure their data are evenly-spaced.
### An example:
### 
### pull data at 6-minute intervals
dat.hr   <- noaa(begindate = "20200101", enddate = "20200630", station = "8467150",
                 interval = "hourly")

### pull data at 1-hr intervals
dat.6min <- noaa(begindate = "20200701", enddate = "20201231", station = "8467150",
                 interval = "6 minute")

dat.combined <- rbind(dat.hr, dat.6min)
### if time interval is inconsistent the HL output can be unreliable
HL.plot(level = dat.combined[, 2], time = dat.combined[, 1]) 

### expand 1-hr dataset using the 6-minute time interval
timeSeq <- data.frame(time_GMT = seq.POSIXt(from = min(dat.hr$time_GMT), 
                                            to = max(dat.hr$time_GMT), 
                                            by = "6 min"))
### create consistently-spaced dataset
dat.hr2       <- plyr::join_all(list(timeSeq, dat.hr))
dat.combined2 <- rbind(dat.hr2, dat.6min)
HL.plot(level = dat.combined2[, 2], time = dat.combined2[, 1])
