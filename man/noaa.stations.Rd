\title{Print active NOAA stations - function is deprecated}
\usage{
noaa.stations(state = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{limits printed records to a state or states of interest. Default is to
show 'all' stations.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with station names, states/territories, and station 
numbers. If a 'state' argument is provided that is not found on the NOAA site, an 
error message is displayed. If a vector of states is provided, some of which are 
invalid, a dataframe will be produced for the valid criteria and invalid criteria 
will be noted.
}
\description{
\code{noaa.stations} returns active NOAA CO-OPS tide stations. This function is deprecated as of 17 Oct 2020, due to a heavy reliance on Javascript in the main NOAA website.
}
\details{
This function returns a dataframe showing all active stations in 
the NOAA CO-OPS network. This can be used to identify stations for use 
in \code{noaa}.
