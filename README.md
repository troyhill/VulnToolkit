VulnToolkit is an R package for users working with coastal datasets. Its primary goal is to advance analysis of coastal wetlands and their vulnerability to sea level rise. The package has two emphases: 

* web scrapers, built to make it easy to bring coastal and estuarine data from online databases into R
* analytical tools, to aid analysis of datasets from coastal and estuarine settings



To install and load VulnToolkit, run the following commands in R:

    install.packages("devtools") # if devtools isn't already installed

    devtools::install_github("troyhill/VulnToolkit")

    library(VulnToolkit)
